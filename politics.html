										<h2>The Political Determinants of Fiscal Governance in the EU: Towards a New Equilibrium</h2>
										<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.et9KQvb7Xfwp4Ed8LfGqfQHaE8?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
									<br>
									<br>
										<p>The article investigates the political determinants of fiscal governance in the EU. <br> Since the outset of the Economic and Monetary Union, the EU adopted a model of fiscal regulation which attempted to keep government debt and deficit in check to avoid “fiscal dominance.”  
											<br>
											<br>
											With the 2020 pandemic, the EU suspended the fiscal rules and adopted a program, Next Generation EU, having some features of a central fiscal capacity. <br> On the bases of comparative federal analysis, the article discusses the political conditions that preside over the formation of a stable central fiscal capacity, here conceptualized as the “triple-T model.” 
										<br>
										<br>
										We argue that, in unions of states, the determinants of a central fiscal capacity consist in the appearance of an existential threat, <br> in the reciprocal trust among national governments for answering the threat with central resources, <br> and an adequately long time planning horizon of national policymakers to apprehend the benefits of those common resources for all member states. 
										<br>
										<br>
										On these bases, <br> the article outlines the contour of a new EU fiscal set up which encompasses an EU central fiscal capacity and robust budget rules framing the fiscal choices of national authorities.

										<h3>Dutch election promises new era and shake-up in politics.</h3>
										<img src="https://www.businessghana.com/cms/img/news/2023-11-16-135003005.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
										<br>
										<br>
										<p>
											There really is a sense of a new era beginning in Dutch politics in next week's snap parliamentary election. <br>

Not only is a party formed only three months ago topping the polls, <br> but the Netherlands could be about to welcome its first female prime minister too.
<br>
<br>

After 13 years as prime minister, Mark Rutte is bowing out and the 22 November election caused by the collapse of his government is being fought on a cluster of domestic crises - from the high cost of living and a shortage of housing,  to healthcare and climate change.
<br>
<br>


Even though it has been only two years since the last vote, many of the leaders standing are new, including the two front-runners.
<br>
Dilan Ye?ilgöz, 46, the new head of Mr Rutte's liberal-conservative VVD and a daughter of Turkish refugees, <br> is now widely tipped to lead her country.
<br>
<br>
Pieter Omtzigt, 49, is riding a wave of popularity in Dutch politics, <br> with his centrist New Social Contract party emerging from nowhere as election favourite. <br> But he has so far been lukewarm about becoming prime minister.

What makes this election highly unpredictable is the significant proportion of floating <br> voters deciding which 26 parties should fill the 150 seats in the Dutch parliament. <br>
<br> There is a minimal threshold and the polls suggest as many as 17 parties could get in. <br> The last coalition took nine months to form and lasted less than two years.

										<h3>Presidential candidates in Madagascar call for election boycott as political crisis deepens</h3>
										<img src="https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1jRkYU.img?w=768&h=432&m=6" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
										<br>
											<br>
										<p>Six prominent presidential candidates in Madagascar told AFP on Monday they plan to boycott this week’s elections, worsening a political crisis engulfing the country.
<br>
											The six, who are part of a larger grouping of opposition candidates holding almost daily protests for weeks, said they will not take part in Thursday’s vote and will urge their supporters not to cast their ballot.
											<br>
											
											
											“We will call (on people) not to go and vote,” said presidential hopeful Marc Ravalomanana, 73, <br> one of two former presidents to join calls for a boycott.
											
											The Indian Ocean island nation has been shaken by a fierce battle between President Andry Rajoelina, who is running for re-election, and most opposition leaders.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											Almost all the 12 opposition candidates in the running have led near daily, unauthorised marches in Antananarivo, for more than a month, protesting at what they have called an “institutional coup” that favours the incumbent. <br>
											The demonstrations have been regularly dispersed by police that on Saturday fired teargas and detained 11 protesters at yet another rally.
											<br>
											<br>
											
											“I will not stand for election, that is very clear,” said Hery Rajaonarimampianina, 65, another former president who was in the running to replace Rajoelina.
											<br>
											
											
											Last week, the head of the lower house of parliament, who leads a mediation group to find a way out of the crisis, called for the suspension of the presidential elections, to ensure “peace” and “harmony”.

								<h3>Civil servants, politicians' corruption, accountability deficit bedevilling Nigeria — Ex-ICPC Chairman</h3>
								<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.0wu192yYj7eqrkfhECgJKAHaE6?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
								<p>The outgoing Chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), Professor Bolaji Owasanoye (SAN), has blamed accountability deficit by top civil servants, politicians and others for the high level of corruption, bedeviling the country.
<br>
<br>
								
									He also explained how lack of administrative experience led some heads of agencies, particularly academics into culpability in acts of corruption.
									
									Speaking at a forum in Abuja tagged ‘Behavioural Change and Conference Exhibition 2023’ organised by the Akin Fadeyi Foundation (AFF) a not-for-profit organisation that employs communications, media, and technology to combat corruption and promote social change in Nigeria, the anti-corruption czar, however, faulted the hasty generalisation that casts aspersion on all Nigerians as corrupt. <br>
									<br> Related PostsNo female worshipper died in MFM — Spokesperson69-year-old retired Oyo perm sec murdered at her Ibadan residenceBoat accidents: Stakeholders raise concern over LAGFERRY, LASWA maintenance culture <br>
									Owasanoye recalled that those in the academics who headed one agency or another became ICPC’s suspects within one year as a result of one infraction or the other.
									
									“And you could see that many of them, walking blind, lacked administrative experience either because they were misled or because they have not read circulars and guidelines that say you can do this, you can’t do that.
									<br>
<br>
									
							
									Couches & Sofas
									“Imagine somebody who hitherto held a global reputation, who won consultancy, earns $20,000, why does he want to come and steal money from an MDA? Except somebody has set a banana peel for him to enable them to do what they want to do and they need to put him in that trap, if he refuses, then they will orchestrate a petition to ICPC, and EFCC, then the man will come and they embarrass him,” Owasanoye said.
									<br>
<br>
									
									He added that most of the people who indulged in such acts were faceless civil servants who misled the heads of agencies in the first place.
									
									The outgoing ICPC Boss stated that not all Nigerians are corrupt, explaining that such default mindset by a generality of people that all Nigerians are corrupt are being challenged in the light of the traditional anti-corruption interventions in Nigeria and the recent efforts towards expanding the focus of anti-corruption interventions to include the behavioural change approach. 
									<br>
<br>
									
									“From my experience in leading the anti-corruption fight at PACAC (Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption) and the ICPC, I can tell you categorically that not all Nigerians are corrupt,” Owasanoye said.</p>

													Cornell, Columbia and UPenn among 7 schools facing Education Dept. probe over allegations of antisemitism and Islamophobia</h3>
												<img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231106182805-miguel-cardona-110223.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/f_webp" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
												<br>
											<br>
										<p>The Department of Education has launched investigations into seven schools, including Cornell University, Columbia University and University of Pennsylvania, after receiving complaints about alleged incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia.
											<br><br>

											The investigations include five antisemitism cases and two Islamophobia cases.
											
											They are the first investigations of this kind by the Department of Education since the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel.
											<br><br>
											
											The schools were informed about the investigations within the last 24 hours. They include one K-12 school, the Maize Unified School District in Kansas, and six colleges: Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, Cornell University in New York, Columbia University in New York, Wellesley College in Massachusetts, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York, and the University of Pennsylvania.
											<br><br>
											
											Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told CNN on Friday that he anticipates more investigations are coming.
											
											A list of K-12 schools and colleges under investigation for possible discrimination based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics is now posted on the Department of Education’s website and will be updated weekly.
											<br><br>
											
											At the conclusion of the investigations, the Department of Education will make recommendations to the schools. The schools risk losing federal funding if they don’t comply.
											
											“If an institution refuses to follow the law to protect students, we would withhold dollars,” Cardona said.
											<br><br>
											The investigations were launched under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which says universities and K-12 schools have a responsibility to provide all students with an environment free from discrimination. Anyone can file a Title VI complaint with the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights.</p>

										<h3>Protests encapsulate progressive angst that could imperil Biden’s 2024 campaign</h3>
										<img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231116210808-biden-file-111623.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/f_webp" alt="" style="width: 100%;" >
										<br>
											<br>
										<p> 
											Israel could not have asked for a better friend than President Joe Biden.
											
											In the anguished aftermath of the horror unleashed by Hamas on October 7, Biden grieved with Israelis as though he was one of them. As global anger mounted at the thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza during Israel’s counter-attack against Hamas, Biden has been unequivocal on the Jewish state’s right to hit back.
											<br><br>
											
											But rising anger and splits inside the Democratic Party over the ferocity of Israel’s incursion into Gaza and the lack of a ceasefire are creating a volatile political mood inside the United States. Dissent and restiveness among younger voters,
											<br><br> and Arab Americans especially, appears to be increasing political risk for Biden on the cusp of the election year. Those divides threaten to exacerbate his weaknesses within his own party, which may pose the biggest risk to his hopes of a second term.</p>
