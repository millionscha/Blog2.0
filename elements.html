										<h2>Gavi: Barcelona midfielder tore ACL on Spain duty and will have surgery, club confirms</h2>
										<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/800/cpsprodpb/113D9/production/_131771607_gettyimages-1802760999.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
									<br>
									<br>
										<p>Barcelona midfielder Gavi tore his anterior cruciate ligament on international duty with Spain and needs surgery, his club has confirmed.

											Gavi, 19, left the pitch in tears on Sunday after landing awkwardly when jumping to control the ball.
											
											Barca said he would have surgery on his right ACL, with a further update on the injury due in "the coming days".
											<br><br>
											Gavi could miss the rest of the season and his chances of playing at Euro 2024 and the Paris Olympics are in doubt.
											
											Barcelona confirmed the "complete tear of the ACL" on Monday and the recovery time for that injury can be eight to 10 months.
											
											Gavi has played 111 games for the Catalan club, scoring seven goals and providing 12 assists while he has made 27 appearances for Spain, scoring five goals.
											<br><br>
											He helped Barca to win the league title and the Spanish Super Cup last season.
											
											Spain boss Luis de la Fuente described Sunday's 3-1 over Georgia in Valladolid as the "most bitter victory I have experienced in my life" because of Gavi's injury after just 26 minutes.

										<h3>Hannes Strydom: Ex-South Africa rugby star dies in car crash.</h3>
										<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CD74/production/_131769525_hannes2.jpg.webp" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
										<br>
										<br>
										<p>
											South Africa's former rugby star Hannes Strydom has died in a car accident at the age of 58.

He was part of the Springbok team that famously won the 1995 Rugby World Cup after the end of apartheid in 1994.

Strydom gained 21 Springbok caps in his career between 1993 and 1997.

Former teammate and close friend Kobus Wiese told local media that details of the accident were still vague, but the vehicle Strydom was travelling in collided with a minibus taxi.
<br><br>
The accident took place on Sunday near the coal mining town of eMalahleni in Mpumalanga province.

South African Rugby Union President Mark Alexander hailed Strydom as "one of the heroes of our local game" in the Springboks' tribute to him.

His former club, the Lions, also paid tribute to him, describing him as a legend who had formed a formidable lock combination with Wiese.
<br><br>
"We share a tight bond as members of the 1995 group and to lose yet another one of our brothers is a big blow," said Lions Rugby Company chief executive officer Rudolf Straeuli.

Strydom made his debut for the Springboks in 1993, and helped defeat arch-rivals New Zealand 15-12 in the 1995 World Cup final in Johannesburg - the biggest sporting event in South Africa after the end of apartheid.

										<h3>Lionel Messi: Six of Argentina captain's shirts from Qatar World Cup triumph to be sold at auction.</h3>
										<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/800/cpsprodpb/9477/production/_131770083_gettyimages-1451356967.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
										<br>
											<br>
										<p>Captain Messi, 36, lifted the trophy after they beat France on penalties in last December's final in Qatar.

											His shirt from the final is included in the set of six, which are expected to fetch more than £8m in the auction hosted by Sotheby's in New York.
											<br><br>
											The record for a game-worn football shirt is Diego Maradona's 'Hand of God' jersey, which sold for £7.1m in 2022.
											
											Brahm Wachter, Sotheby's head of modern collectibles, said the sale of Messi's six shirts "stands as a monumental occasion in auction history".
											
											"The 2022 Fifa World Cup stands as one of the greatest events in sports history, intrinsically connected to Messi's valiant journey and firmly establishing his status as the greatest player of all time," Wachter said.
											<br><br>
											Messi, an eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, became the first player in World Cup history to score in the group stage, last 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals and final of a single tournament.
											
											Wachter added: "It is an honour for Sotheby's to present and exhibit these invaluable collectables to the public, which encapsulate the sheer brilliance of a player who has redefined the boundaries of football excellence."
											
											The collection of Messi's shirts will be on view at Sotheby's New York headquarters in a free, public exhibition during the bidding process, which is open between 30 November and 14 December.</p>

								<h3>Andre Onana: Manchester United goalkeeper injured on Cameroon duty</h3>

								<p>Goalkeeper Andre Onana will return to Manchester United to discover the extent of an injury sustained playing for Cameroon in a World Cup qualifier.

									Onana, 27, was substituted in the 81st minute of Friday's 3-0 victory over Mauritius in Douala, having been injured making a save.
									
									The goalkeeper has pulled out of Cameroon's squad for Tuesday's match against Libya.
									
									Cameroon officials did not give details of the type or severity of the injury.
									<br><br>
									Onana, signed from Inter Milan for £47.2m in July, has played in all 18 of United's competitive fixtures so far this season.
									
									United manager Erik ten Hag is already facing a number of injury issues as his squad prepare to return from the international break with a Premier League trip to Everton on 26 November and a Champions League visit to Galatasaray three days later.
									
									Lisandro Martinez (foot), Casemiro (thigh) and Christian Eriksen (knee) are all definitely out while Luke Shaw (muscle problem), Jonny Evans (thigh), Tyrell Malacia (knee), Aaron Wan-Bissaka (illness) and Rasmus Hojlund (thigh) are facing a race to be fit in time.</p>

											James, who also added eight assists and six rebounds, made one of two free throws to give Los Angeles the lead with 1.9 seconds remaining.
											
											Dillon Brooks missed a three-point attempt for the Rockets at the buzzer.

												<h3>
													Why Everton points deduction sent shockwaves through the Premier League</h3>
												<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/800/cpsprodpb/3895/production/_131758441_table.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
												<br>
											<br>
										<p>An independent commission's decision to dock Everton 10 points for breaching Premier League financial rules could have seismic ramifications, and the fallout is being felt well beyond Goodison Park.

											Stunned Everton fans may take some comfort from the sense they at least now know where they stand. But while the severity of the punishment meted out may have dismayed many, there is a very real danger that the situation facing the club could soon become even more serious.
											<br><br>
											The most obvious outstanding questions facing Everton are: whether the points deduction will ultimately condemn the club to relegation, and also, what the outcome of any appeal will be.
											
											But it is clearly significant that the chair of the commission said he was "satisfied" that several rival clubs "have potential claims for compensation".
											<br><br>
											Leicester City and Leeds United (both relegated last season) and Burnley (relegated in 2022), are reportedly pressing ahead with plans to sue Everton for millions of pounds' worth of damages. They have a month to decide if they will pursue.
											<br>
											It would not be the first time such a scenario has unfolded. Back in 2009, for instance, West Ham agreed to pay Sheffield United a reported £20m in compensation as part of a settlement after a long legal dispute over the Carlos Tevez eligibility case. United had launched a claim after being relegated instead of the Tevez-inspired Hammers.</p>

										<h3>ATP Finals 2023 results: Novak Djokovic beats Jannik Sinner to win title</h3>
										<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/800/cpsprodpb/14FCE/production/_131766958_gettyimages-1802483919.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%;" >
										<br>
											<br>
										<p> 
											Novak Djokovic won a record seventh ATP Finals title with a dominant victory over Jannik Sinner that marked another milestone in his memorable season.

The Serb, 36, who lost to the Italian in the group stage, avenged that with a 6-3 6-3 win in Turin, Italy.

He has set records in rankings and titles this year and played some of his best tennis against the youngsters - like Sinner - trying to challenge him.
<br><br>
"One of the best seasons I've had in my life, no doubt," Djokovic said.

"It's very special. To crown it against a hometown hero in Jannik this week is phenomenal," he added in comments to Amazon Prime.

"Tactically I played differently today than in the group stage against Jannik. Overall, a phenomenal week."

Before the singles final, there was British success in the doubles when Joe Salisbury and American partner Rajeev Ram retained their title with a straight-set win over Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos.</p>
										
								<h3>Newcastle & Manchester United: Why are Premier League injuries at a new high?</h3>

								<p>When Newcastle defender Kieran Trippier confronted his own "emotional" fans after the defeat at Bournemouth his message was clear: "How many injuries have we got?" he repeated three times.

									The Magpies are currently the worst-hit team in the Premier League with 11 players injured - and the total across the league this season has hit a new high.
									<br><br>
									There have been 196 injuries in just over three months at the start of the 2023-24 top-flight season, according to data analyst Ben Dinnery, founder of Premier Injuries - a 15% increase compared with the past four campaigns.
									
									What is the full data? Why are so many players getting injured, and is this a trend? BBC Sport takes a look.</p>

									<h3>Gareth Southgate: England boss targets world number one ranking</h3>

									<p>The Three Lions, who are currently fourth in Fifa's rankings, take on North Macedonia in their final Euro 2024 qualifier on Monday.

										England have already qualified for the tournament in Germany and a draw would guarantee they are among the top seeds.
										
										"If you're going to be the top-ranked team, there's no room for sloppiness or casualness," said Southgate.
										<br><br>
										"If we're going to be a top team then the level of performance has got to be spot on every time."
										
										World Cup winners Argentina are currently top of the rankings with France second and Brazil third, while England have spent five consecutive years inside the top five.
										
										The Three Lions could rise to third in the world, leapfrogging Brazil, when the next update is announced on 30 November - but Southgate wants to reach the summit.
										<br><br>
										"Am I driven by being ranked number one? Yes, because ultimately you achieve that through consistency and you've got to play well in the tournaments as well because the ranking points are higher in the tournaments," said Southgate.
										
										"Also, it sets behaviours every day on the training pitch, off the training pitch.</p>
